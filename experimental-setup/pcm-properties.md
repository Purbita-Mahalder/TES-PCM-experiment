# Phase Change Material (PCM) Properties

This project utilized a commercially available paraffin‐based phase change material for latent heat thermal energy storage (TES). Paraffin waxes are widely used in small- and medium-scale TES applications because of their technical maturity, chemical stability, and nearly isothermal phase transition.

## 1. PCM Selection Rationale
Paraffin was chosen because it offers:

- **High latent heat** suitable for storing solar-derived thermal energy  
- **Stable melting–solidification behavior** with minimal degradation over multiple cycles  
- **Non-corrosive and chemically inert characteristics**, enabling use with common metals  
- **Low cost and easy availability** in the Bangladeshi market  
- **Safety advantages** (non-toxic and non-flammable compared to some salt hydrates)

The chosen melting range aligns with typical output temperatures from small-scale solar thermal collectors.

## 2. Key Thermophysical Properties  
*(Representative values from manufacturer datasheet and literature)*

| Property | Typical Value | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Melting range | ~56–58°C | Suitable for low-temperature solar TES |
| Latent heat of fusion | ~180–210 kJ/kg | Enables high energy density |
| Specific heat (solid) | ~2.0 kJ/kg·K | |
| Specific heat (liquid) | ~2.1 kJ/kg·K | |
| Thermal conductivity | ~0.2 W/m·K | Intrinsically low → requires embedded tubes |
| Density (solid) | ~880–900 kg/m³ | |
| Density (liquid) | ~760–780 kg/m³ | |
| Volume expansion | ~10–12% | Must be accommodated during tank design |

## 3. PCM Preparation & Handling
- PCM was heated gradually in a controlled water bath until fully liquified.  
- Air entrapped during melting was allowed to escape to prevent void formation.  
- The molten PCM was then poured into the tank and into the tubes at consistent fill levels.  
- Cooling was allowed to occur naturally to ensure a uniform solidification front.

## 4. Role of PCM in the TES System
The PCM serves as the **primary thermal buffer**, absorbing excess thermal energy during the charging stage and releasing it during the discharge stage. Its isothermal melting profile ensures:

- Stable output temperatures  
- Compatibility with solar-heated heat-transfer fluids  
- Efficient storage–release behavior even at small scales

## 5. Limitations of the PCM  
- Very low thermal conductivity → requires conductive tubes  
- Slight supercooling may occur in some cycles  
- Thermal performance depends significantly on tube geometry  

These limitations are mitigated through optimized tube selection and heat-transfer design, which is one of the core focuses of this project.
