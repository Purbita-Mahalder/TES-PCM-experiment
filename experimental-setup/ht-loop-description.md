# Heat-Transfer Loop Description

This document provides an overview of the solar-driven heat-transfer (HT) loop used to charge and discharge the PCM-based thermal energy storage (TES) system. The description is generalized for portfolio use and avoids institution-specific specifications.

## 1. System Overview
The TES unit was integrated with a **closed-loop water circulation system**, in which water served as the heat-transfer fluid (HTF). The loop was powered by a small **solar parabolic trough collector (PTC)** capable of delivering low- to medium-grade thermal energy suitable for melting paraffin-based PCM.

## 2. Components of the HT Loop

### **1. Solar Parabolic Trough Collector**
- Concentrates solar radiation onto a receiver tube  
- Heats the HTF to temperatures exceeding the PCM melting point  
- Operated under natural solar conditions

### **2. Storage Tank (TES Unit)**
- 18 L cylindrical tank (commercial)  
- Holds PCM and removable tube bundles  
- Insulated externally to minimize thermal losses

### **3. Circulation Pump**
- Maintains continuous HTF flow through the system  
- Ensures uniform charging during melting  
- Low-flow pump selected to match experimental scale

### **4. Piping and Valves**
- Thermally insulated pipes carry water from the collector to the TES unit  
- Two manual valves regulate:
  - **Charging mode** (solar-heated water)  
  - **Discharging mode** (cold water)

### **5. Temperature Measurement Points**
Sensors/loggers were placed at:
- HTF inlet  
- HTF outlet  
- PCM interior (multiple locations)  
- Ambient reference  

These measurements were recorded at regular intervals to track thermal performance.

## 3. Operating Procedure

### **Charging Stage**
1. Solar-heated HTF enters the TES tank.  
2. Hot water flows across the embedded tube bundle.  
3. PCM surrounding the tubes absorbs heat and begins to melt.  
4. Charging continues until:
   - HTF temperatures stabilize  
   - PCM reaches near-complete melting  

### **Thermal Retention Stage**
- After charging, the system is sealed.  
- No flow occurs.  
- The PCM’s ability to retain heat is monitored for several hours.

### **Discharging Stage**
1. Cold or ambient-temperature water is circulated instead of hot water.  
2. PCM releases stored heat as it solidifies.  
3. Discharge ends when PCM temperature approaches equilibrium.

## 4. Safety & Controls
- Mechanical pressure relief from thermal expansion  
- Insulation to prevent heat loss and accidental contact  
- Stable pump operating range  
- Manual shut-off for emergencies

## 5. Purpose in the Portfolio
This HT loop illustrates practical experience with:

- Experimental TES system design  
- Solar-thermal integration  
- Charging–discharging thermodynamics  
- Real-world heat-transfer behavior of PCM systems
