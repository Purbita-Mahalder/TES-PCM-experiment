# TES-PCM-experiment
Experimental Investigation of Tube Geometry Effects in PCM-Based Thermal Energy Storage Systems

Undergraduate Research Project (2024–2025)

This repository presents a non-confidential, portfolio-ready overview of my undergraduate thesis project, which experimentally examined how tube diameter, tube number, and tube material influence the charging, retention, and discharging performance of phase change material (PCM)-based thermal energy storage (TES) systems.

The full thesis is not uploaded for confidentiality reasons.
This repository includes high-level summaries, sanitized figures, and conceptual descriptions of methods, designed to demonstrate my research capability in thermal systems, heat transfer, and renewable energy engineering.

The objective was to identify an optimal tube configuration that balances thermal performance, stored energy, and system cost, thereby supporting the design of efficient TES units for solar thermal applications.

Motivation

PCMs exhibit high latent heat capacity but suffer from very low thermal conductivity, leading to slow charge/discharge rates.
Embedding metal tubes into PCM tanks enhances heat transfer, but the trade-off between: PCM volume, heat-transfer area, tube material cost, and geometric configuration is not well understood due to a lack of systematic experimental comparisons under identical conditions.

This study addresses that gap.

🧪Experimental Summary

Two identical TES tanks (18 L) filled with paraffin wax (56–58°C melting point) were tested with embedded tube bundles of varying:
Tube diameters: 9.5 mm, 12.7 mm, 15.9 mm

Tube numbers: adjusted to maintain equal insertion height and consistent PCM mass

Materials: copper vs. aluminum

Tanks were charged using solar parabolic trough–heated water and evaluated for:

Temperature gradiant across daytime

stored heat

retention characteristics

discharge duration

heat-transfer-area correlation

📈 Key Findings

1. Tube geometry has the strongest effect on thermal storage performance.

2. Medium-diameter tubes provided the best balance between heat-transfer area and PCM volume.

3. Copper tubes demonstrated superior charging efficiency due to higher thermal conductivity.

4. Excessive tube density reduces net PCM mass and lowers stored energy — an important practical design constraint.

5. A non-linear relationship exists between heat-transfer area and stored energy, confirming that optimization—not maximization—is key.
